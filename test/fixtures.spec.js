His drawing of the Vitruvian Man (c. 1490) has also become a cultural icon. Leonardo is sometimes credited as the inventor of the tank, helicopter, parachute, and flying machine, among other vehicles and devices, but later scholarship has disputed such claims. Nonetheless, Leonardo's notebooks reveal a sharp intellect, and his contributions to art, including methods of representing space, threedimensional objects, and the human figure, cannot be overstated.",

The term Post-Impressionism was coined by the English art critic Roger Fry for the work of such late 19th-century painters as Paul C√©zanne, Georges Seurat, Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and others. All of these painters except van Gogh were French, and most of them began as Impressionists; each of them abandoned the style, however, to form his own highly personal art.

Scholars no longer believe that the Renaissance marked an abrupt break with medieval values, as is suggested by the French word renaissance, literally ‚Äúrebirth.‚Äù Rather, historical sources suggest that interest in nature, humanistic learning, and individualism were already present in the late medieval period and became dominant in 15th- and 16th-century Italy concurrently with social and economic changes such as the secularization of daily life, the rise of a rational money-credit economy, and greatly increased social mobility.",

There is so much to see on different floors, you would need several hours to really look at everything in detail and read through! Of course, you have to be aware that it is very crowded inside and you sometimes have to wait to be able to read through a picture or a description. Especially before the night watch you have to fight for your slot. Also the museum garden and the library are dreamlike!‚ù§Ô∏èüå∑",
